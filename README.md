In the financial landscape, the ability to accurately predict loan defaults is of paramount importance. This predictive capability not only mitigates risk for lenders but also aids in making informed credit decisions. To address this critical need, this project embarks on the development of a loan default prediction application. This application leverages machine learning techniques to analyze historical loan data and forecast the likelihood of futureÂ defaults.
